**Kingston, Jamaica — 15 October 2025**

The Cultural and Creative Industries Alliance of Jamaica (CCIAJ), a grouping of industry associations including Kingston Creative, BIAJ, JAFTA, WIFT, JaRIA, Dream Entertainment, Montego Bay Creative Arts Network and others has officially launched the 2025 Jamaica Creative and Cultural Industries Survey Report, providing the clearest, data-driven picture yet of Jamaica’s dynamic creative economy. In attendance were representatives from JAMPRO, PIOJ, the Social Development Commission, the University of the West Indies, JBDC and the National Library of Jamaica.

The findings underscore the sector’s economic and cultural significance: Jamaica’s creative industries contribute an estimated JMD $107 billion annually, representing 5.1% of national GDP, with an upper estimate of $160 billion or 7.6%. Kemesha Kelly Swaby, Special Projects manager at Bluedot stated that even the conservative figure far exceeds the global average, reinforcing that the creative sector is not just a source of cultural pride in Jamaica, but a strategic economic asset, capable of driving national development, job creation, and innovation.

However, the report also issued a challenge - data collection alone is not enough. It called for decisive, coordinated action to address the main systemic barriers that limit growth and inclusion. Based on the survey’s findings, the CCIAJ has outlined three key calls to action:

1. **Develop a National Collaborative Framework  
    The CCIAJ called for a unified national framework that brings together government, multilaterals, private sector, diaspora, academia, and practitioners. This structure would strengthen cultural governance, improve policy coherence, and ensure sustained public investment. A proposed National CCI Data & Insights Programme would build on this survey’s baseline to better target resources and measure impact.
2. **Make Strategic Investments in Creative Businesses  
	The report identifies a JMD $5 billion financing gap and revealed that 88% of creatives require access to capital. CCIAJ urges financial institutions and investors to develop creative-specific financial products and treat the creative industries as a high-growth market opportunity.
3. **Develop a National Performing Arts and Events Complex  
     Practitioners across the island have voiced a need for purpose-built creative hubs. The CCIAJ proposes Jamaica’s first full-scale Performing Arts & Events Complex, a flagship Catalyst Project featuring performance venues, rehearsal spaces, exhibition halls, production studios, and digital broadcast facilities. This would serve as a legacy project and model for similar hubs across the island, anchoring Jamaica’s creative ecosystem and securing its future.

Shullette Cox, President of JAMPRO stated, “I think this initiative to create and present data on the creative industries is a huge move in making others understand the potential of the industry, particularly government, financial institutions, and our global partners. And I believe that once we can get this information in front of them, then we can unlock numerous opportunities to do so much more for the industry.”

The survey was developed by the creatives themselves, who had a high level of trust which allowed them to collect financial data with ease. It also highlighted the diversity and geographical spread of the creative economy, spanning music, film, visual arts, theatre, fashion, literature, gaming, festivals, culinary arts, and crafts. Yet, with 56% of practitioners based in Kingston and St. Andrew, regional investment and creative infrastructure remain critical priorities.

“Building on the baseline established by this survey, we envision developing a National CCI Data & Insights programme that will help target resources more effectively, identify high-growth and vulnerable groups, and track key indicators over time,”  Said Kaiel Eytle, Former JAFTA Board Member, Co-Chair of CCIAJ. “ When we plan together using evidence, we grow together with purpose. Better data leads to better policy, and to better outcomes for not only for creatives but for our country.”
