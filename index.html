# About the CCIAJ
The Cultural and Creative Industries Association of Jamaica (CCIAJ) is a national non-profit organization dedicated to advancing Jamaica’s vibrant cultural and creative sectors.
Formed through collaboration among key creative organizations, CCIAJ serves as a unified voice for artists, entrepreneurs, and institutions across the creative landscape.
The Association promotes a sustainable, inclusive, and globally competitive creative economy—one that celebrates Jamaican identity, supports innovation, and builds the capacity of those who create, produce, and distribute our cultural expressions.
CCIAJ operates as a legally registered, non-profit entity under the Laws of Jamaica, committed to collaboration, transparency, and the empowerment of the cultural and creative community through advocacy, research, and partnership.
